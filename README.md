## About
20 Robot Dj's have been created to perform for your listening pleasure. Genetic data has been collected, processed and analysed from 20 of the most prolific superclub DJs on the planet. This data has been harnessed in the creation of our 20 robots. We have kept our recreations as true as possible, therefore as you will hear, Random tunes are picked from the 7digital library and we have gone to great pains to ensure that no live mixing occurs.
We'd like to say that no harm came to any DJs during the DNA collection process, as you will be glad to hear... we cannot. We collected from David Guetta twice... Just to make sure.

## What?
We created MiXBiT for the Node Knockout 48 hour hackaton.
